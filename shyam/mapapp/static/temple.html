    <p>The Thanjavur Periya Kovil, officially the Brihadeeswarar Temple, is an 11th-century temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, built by the Chola king Rajaraja I. It is a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture, notable for being built entirely of granite and for its towering, 66-meter-high vimana tower. The temple is dedicated to Shiva and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the "Great Living Chola Temples". </p>
