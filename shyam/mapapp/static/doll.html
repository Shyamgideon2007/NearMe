    <p>Thanjavur dancing dolls, also known as Thanjavur Thalaiyatti Bommai, are traditional South Indian bobblehead dolls from Tamil Nadu, handmade from terracotta or paper mache. Their unique feature is a weighted, rounded base that causes the head to bobble and sway rhythmically, creating a dancing-like movement. They depict figures from Indian mythology and culture and are often used in festivals like Navratri. </p>
